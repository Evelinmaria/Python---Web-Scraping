# Python---Web-Scraping
### - By Evelin Maria Zen
### What is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is a method to extract large amount of data from internet. Internet is the greatest source of information. By this web scraping method, it is able to collect the data from internet and extract only the relevant information.
### Web Scraper Function
##### 1. Making an HTTP request by client to the web server
Web scraper needs permission to access the website's data. Once the permission is accepted, web scraper can access the site and all the information on it.
##### 3. Breaking down the website's code
Once a website gives a scraper access, the bot can read and extract the site’s HTML or XML code. This code determines the website’s content structure. The scraper will then parse the code (which basically means breaking it down into its constituent parts) so that it can identify and extract elements or objects that have been predefined by whoever set the bot loose! These might include specific text, ratings, classes, tags, IDs, or other information.
##### 4. Saving the relevant data locally
Once the HTML or XML has been accessed, scraped, and parsed, the web scraper will then store the relevant data locally. As mentioned, the data extracted is predefined by you (having told the bot what you want it to collect). Data is usually stored as structured data, often in an Excel file, such as a .csv or .xls format.
